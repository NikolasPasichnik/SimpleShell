# SimpleShell

In this assignment, we were required to create a C program that implements a shell interface that 
accepts user commands and executes each command in a separate process. This shell program provides 
a command prompt, where the user inputs a line of command. It is responsible for executing the 
command. The shell program assumes that the first string of the line gives the name of the executable 
file. The remaining strings in the line are considered arguments for the command. 

# Built-in Commands 

A command is considered built-in, when all the functionality is completely built into the shell (i.e., 
without relying on an external program. All other commands, like `cat` or `ls`, call external programs to execute. Here is a list of the commands that have been implemented from scratch in this shell interface: 

- `echo`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `exit`
- `fg`
- `jobs`
- 

# Other Features 

- Simple Output Redirection


- Simple Command Piping
